# Rollit Game with pygame
This is the second project of the principles and fundamentals of AI course which an agent is designed for the rollit game and supports the 4-player game and the 2-player game. Also, minimax, probabilistic minimax, and alpha-beta pruning algorithms are implemented in this project.

To run the part of MinimaxAgent, you can use "python rollit.py -q q1" or "python rollit.py -a MinimaxAgent -d 2 -ea PartiallyRandomAgent -ds minimal" command.

You can use q2 for alpha-beta pruning, q3 for ExpectimaxAgent, and q4 for betterEvaluationFunction.

To see how the agent works, you can use console or graphic for -ds flag.
